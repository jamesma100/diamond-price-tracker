            When you enter your data, it is entered as input into a machine learning algorithm,
            which outputs the predicted cost of your diamond. Our model is trained on existing
            data on diamond prices and their relationship to key attributes in the market. The
            price of a diamond is heavily dependent on its carat, cut, color, and clarity, but we
            also used other attributes in training our model. If you are considering purchasing a
            diamond, make sure it is certified.
